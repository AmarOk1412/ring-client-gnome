ring-client-gnome
*****************

Ring-client-gnome is a Ring client written in GTK+3. It uses libRingClient to
communicate with the Ring daemon and for all of the underlying models and their
logic. Ideally ring-client-gnome should only contain UI related code and any
wrappers necessary for interacting with libRingClient.


Requirements
==================

- Ring daemon
- libRingClient (Qt5 version)
- GTK+3 (3.10 or higher)
- Qt5 Core


Compiling
==================

In the project root dir:
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make

Then simply run ./ring-client-gnome


Building without installing Ring daemon and libRingClient
==================

It is possible to build ring-client-gnome without installing the deamon and
libRingClient on your system (eg: in /usr or /usr/local):

1. build the daemon
2. when building libRingClient, specify the location of the daemon lib in the
   cmake options with -DRING_BUILD_DIR=, eg:
   -DRING_BUILD_DIR=/home/user/ring/daemon/src
3. to get the proper headers, we still need to 'make install' libRingClient, but
   we don't have to install it in /usr, so just specify another location for the
   install prefix in the cmake options, eg:
   -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/user/ringinstall
4. now compile libRingClient and do 'make install', everything will be installed
   in the dir specified by the prefix
4. now we just have to give the same install prefix to the cmake options of the
   client and it will find libRingClient:
   -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/user/ringinstall


Debugging
==================

For now, the build type of the client is "Debug" by default, however it is
useful to also have the debug symbols of libRingClient. To do this, specify this
when compiling libRingClient with '-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug' in the cmake
options.
