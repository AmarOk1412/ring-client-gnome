Translation guide:

The client uses gettext for translations, for a comprehensive guide see:
http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.htm

In order to generate the .pot (template) file with all the translation strings,
append all the filenames that require translation to POTFILES.in, then run the
following command:
xgettext -d ring-client-gnome -o ring-client-gnome.pot -k_ -D .. -f POTFILES.in

The translation files are expected to be located in the /po dir using the
following naming convention:
<language code>[_<country code>].po
for example: fr_CA.po, lt.po

The Ring project uses Transifex.com to facilitate the translation process. The
